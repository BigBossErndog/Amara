## About
A C++ game framework built on top of SDL2.

Enough features to make a full game, still working on more features to match the capabilities of other frameworks.

This will be updated as the framework becomes more feature complete, documentation will also be in the works eventually.
For building on Windows, either CMake or MinGW will be necessary.

Please reach out to me if you would be interested in learning how to use it.

## Why does this exist?

Alternative work flow based on Actors and Recitalsm, makes it easier to program behaviors into the game. Some design decisions are also borrowed from the Phaser.io Javascript framework, which I like and became accustomed to. I wanted to emulate the architecture of some of my web games in C++, as my eventual aim will be to build native cross-platform games for many devices such as Nintendo Switch.
